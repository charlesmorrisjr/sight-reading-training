# Initial
i want to create a sight reading training app for piano.

i want to use the abcjs library to display the music.

The front end should be a web app that can be used on any device especially tablets like iPads.

The design should be simple, modern, and clean.

The app should be able to generate random music in any key and any time signature.

Users should be able to select the key and time signature they want to practice.

Users should be able to select the number of measures they want to practice.

Users should be able to select the intervals they want to practice from a 2nd to an 8th.

Users should be able to select from a range of note durations from 1/16 to whole notes.

The attached file is a simple MVP of the product, but the finished product should look professional. You can take the music generation code and include it in the final product, or create a placeholder for it instead.
